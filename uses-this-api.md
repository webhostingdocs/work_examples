[The Setup](https://usesthis.com "The Setup/Uses This") is a website with the tagline “What do people use to get stuff done?” The site publishes interviews with people mainly from the tech/startup/artist crowd, asking what equipment and software and other gear they use to do their jobs or pursue their hobbies. 

The website has a simple RESTful API with requests and responses in JSON. There is [minimal documentation](https://usesthis.com/api/ "Uses This API") for the API, so I updated the documentation on my own as an exercise in creating simple but useful documentation for a RESTful API. 

**Note** - I am not affiliated with the website or its author, just a fan who has been reading the site almost since its launch.
